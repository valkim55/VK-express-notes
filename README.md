# Welcome to your Notekeeper Express
#### It's almost like a gamekeeper on Hogwarts Express but not really.<br>
#### Anyways, this is the place where you can store anything from your karaoke song list to that long text message draft you were meaning to send two months ago.<br>
#### This application has a simple and efficient functionality and is very easy to use.
<br></br>

> ### **Functionality**
The application has a user friendly interface - once you load it, the homepage will be displayed as shown below:<br>

<br></br>

After you press **"Get Started"** you will be redirected to the main page with two section, as you ca see here:<br>

<br></br>

- To _**create**_ a new note, click '+' icon button at the top right corner.<br>
- To _**save**_ a note you have to type in **both title and text body**. Once you done typing you will see a flat disk icon button appear in the top right corner, hit that button to save. And voila, now your note is added to the list on the left side.
- To _**delete**_ a note from the list on the left side, simply press the note so the contents appear on the right and press delete icon button. <br>
_P.S. since this is the first production of this app you might need to refresh the page to make sure the note was deleted_
