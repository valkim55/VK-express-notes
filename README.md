# Welcome to your Notekeeper Express
#### It's almost like a gamekeeper on Hogwarts Express but not really.<br>
#### Anyways, this is the place where you can store anything from your Karaoke song list to that long text message draft you were meaning to send two months ago.<br>
#### This application has a simple and efficient functionality and is very easy to use.
<br></br>

> ### **Functionality**
The application has a simple user interface where you can type in the contents of the note and a short title, click '+' to save the note.<br>
The list of the notes will then be visible on the left side of the screen, where you can click on a note and delete it if needed.
